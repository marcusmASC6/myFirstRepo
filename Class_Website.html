    	Burger King Grilled Chicken Sandwich
    </h1>
    <table>
    	<td valign = "top">Burger King’s Whopper consists of a sesame seed bun, a flame broiled burger patty, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, mayo, and ketchup. Not sporting any cheese in its original form concerns me, for I’ve always been a fan of cheeseburgers opposed to hamburgers. So I forked over the extra $.44 to get the cheese. But that’s just my personal preference.

The Whopper truly shined during my review. I’ve always liked the taste of BK’s burgers. Supposedly they’re cooked over flames, though I’ve never witnessed anything more than heating trays in the back. Whatever it is, the burgers have always had a distinct taste that is genuine and unique. The toppings were fresh and throughout the meal I nary needed a napkin. The short and wide approach has always worked for many humans, and it works here when it comes to burgers.



I’m going to give the Whopper a 4/5. I’m aware this might cause stirs from the McDonald’s nation, but I won’t lie about my opinions. A less sloppy and tastier treat will bag this boy every time.

As a side note, I want to make everyone aware of the fact that BK houses one of my all time favorite sauces. Entitled the “Zesty Sauce”, the sauce is a creamy horseradish-esque tapestry that accompanies the onion rings.



Despite this, I enjoy dipping my fries in it as well. It is in fact zesty and tangy. I really like this stuff, I even went as far as telling g and double g reader Kristy that if they bottled the stuff, I’d probably put it on my cereal”. However, I quickly rescinded the comment, based on the fact that onion ring sauce would probably damper most anyone’s Frosted Flakes.



Anyways, the Whopper is tasty burger that edges out the Big Mac in my book. Go out and try some Zesty Sauce too. You won’t regret it.

    	Wendy's Baconator
    </h1>
    <table>
    	<td valign = "top">With all that meat and its nutritional values, the Baconator is not a burger that you would want to eat often or during your recovery from triple bypass surgery or in the middle of a Weight Watchers meeting or in the lion’s den at a zoo or at a PETA protest. But if you can eat several of these in one sitting, you should be given the nickname, “Baconator-tor.”

Despite its unhealthiness and fugliness in the picture above, the Baconator a pretty good burger. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but it’s a pretty dense burger. As a matter of fact, when I was carrying the paper Wendy’s bag it came in, it kind of felt like it was going to fall through the bottom.

As for its taste, the smokiness from the bacon complimented well with the juicy ground beef patties and the two slices of cheese. The ketchup and mayonnaise added a nice creamy tomato flavor to it. All together, it created a simple, classic taste, like something I would’ve gotten from a drive-in restaurant from the 1950s.

But all is not perfect with this burger. Wendy’s claims the Baconator has six strips of bacon, and it technically does, but those strips were awfully short. I know bacon shrinks significantly when cooked, but it would probably take two or three strips from the Baconator to equal one strip of bacon from a package I bought from the store and fried on my own.

Overall, it’s a really good burger. Although, after eating one, I feel like my lifespan has shortened a little bit. Again, it’s simple with a classic taste, which I really like.

    	McDonald's Big Mac
    </h1>
    	<table>
    	<td valign = "top">What you see here, is one sloppy ordeal. Loaded with artificially grown lettuce, a jumbo jet filled with sauce, and did I mention that with the Big Mac I could never tell the difference between the onions and the lettuce? Anyway, I couldn’t even figure out how to grapple this beast. Heading to work after wards, I was stuck with the fact that I didn’t want to have that homeless/McDonald’s smell on me all day.



Little did I know that this sandwich was a two faced creation. One side actually sorta looked like the photos, while the other side looked as if three blind lunch ladies from Western Tibet had assembled it. So I grabbed the sandwich, took a bite of that wondrous beast. Great taste, great ambiance, everything was going smoothly, until I decided to set the sandwich down. Immediately it fell apart.



This is what I was left with. Needless to say I struggled the rest of the way but I still finished. There’s something about the Big Mac that keeps me coming back, whether its the fact that I know I shouldn’t be eating it or that it actually tastes good, I always end up finding myself buying another one. I say this because every time I eat one, I feel like a wounded duck for approximately five hours. My stomach tightens, my brain pulsates, colors begin to change, whatever it is, things just don’t feel right. This is what we call the fast food feeling. You literally feel like you have brain damage and nothing does it better than the Big Mac.

So in regards to the classic, I give the Big Mac a 3.5/5. It always tastes good but because of the fact that I physically feel it killing me, I can’t rate it too much higher.

3.5/5
